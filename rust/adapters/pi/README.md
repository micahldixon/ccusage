# ccusage-adapter-pi

The Pi adapter: it turns Pi agent stores, including additional named stores from the config file
into the usage entries the reports render.

## Owns

- `loader.rs` — reading the source, dedupe, and date filtering.
- `parser.rs` — raw record parsing, token mapping, and model naming.
- `paths.rs` — environment variables, default directories, and file discovery.
- `report.rs` — the JSON and table shapes where they differ from the shared ones.

Anything that is not specific to this source belongs in `ccusage-core` or
`ccusage-adapter-common` instead.

## Data source

- `${PI_AGENT_DIR:-~/.pi/agent/sessions}`, plus any `pi.stores[]` entries in `ccusage.json`

Record shapes, token mapping, and cost rules are documented in [`src/README.md`](src/README.md).

Reads plain files through `ccusage-adapter-common`, which handles walking, size-balanced
chunking, and ordered parallel reads.

## Build layer

Built in the `adapters` Crane artifact layer; the layer compiles all adapters in one Cargo invocation, so they build concurrently.
