# Reproducibly regenerate compacted models.dev snapshots from the pinned
# `models-dev` flake input. The upstream repository ships per-model TOML sources
# rather than a prebuilt catalog, so we run their own `generateCatalog` routine
# (via the sibling `gen.ts`) with Bun. Its only runtime dependencies are `remeda`
# and `zod`, resolved by bun2nix from the `package.json` next to this file.
#
# The build outputs are copied into the repository (see
# `just gen-models-dev-pricing`) and embedded at build time, so every platform
# ships identical pinned data without build-time network access.
