# hawk, a workspace-aware Cargo lint for unnecessary Rust visibility.
#
# The upstream release is used rather than a source build because hawk links
# against `rustc_private` and would otherwise need the `rustc-dev` component and
# `RUSTC_BOOTSTRAP=1`. A prebuilt binary carries the same constraint in a simpler
# form: it only runs on the compiler it was built against, which is why
# rust-toolchain.toml pins the version in `supportedRustChannel` below.
