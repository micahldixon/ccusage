# Conventional Commit scopes here name the agent that changed, not the directory
# holding it: `fix(kimi)`, `feat(codex)`. Nothing about a subject line reveals an
# invented scope on its own — `feat(coding)` reads fine until you know the change
# was codex — so this reads the ownership off the staged paths instead.
#
# The commit-msg hook runs this. A squash merge writes the pull request title
# instead of these subjects, so the same rules are applied to PR titles by
# .github/workflows/check-pr-title.yaml; keep the two in step.
